# First
Here is my first project for GitHub!

Lets see if we can make something amazing!

Files uploaded and ready to go.

Struggling to use localStorage so that the system can remember the temperature of the home. Any advice?

Will focus most efforts on the Personal Website and may review this project when the site is up and running.
